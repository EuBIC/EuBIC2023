## Preample

We believe in the [FAIR Principles for Research Software](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068) (FAIR4RS Principles). A "fresh look" is outlined [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921000362?via%3Dihub).

Any code developed during the hackathons should be distributed under an open-source license.


## Scope

Your project should not be to complex and be finishable in about 3 days by a team of max. 10 developers. Don't assume that everybody is a full-blown coding expert! You might budget extra time for explaining common tools like your favourite code reporsitory or whatever tools should be used by the project team. Coding style, documentation, unit testing and CI are also important aspects that might be worth touching on. Try to break down your project into manageable smaller subunits that can be solved 2-3 people working in parallel. Always keep in mind that parts still need to come back together, so interface design/definition might also be a topic.

## Submission

Topics for the hackathon sessions during the EuBIC 2023 Developers Meeting can now be proposed!

We are currently **crowd sourcing** projects to connect bioinformaticians. You can **vote for your favorite projects** and international 
task forces will be created around the most successful proposals. 
Projects with most votes will be presented at the Developers Meeting and included in coding sessions!

These projects can include, but are not limited to:

  -   Tools    
    - Extension of existing bioinformatics tools under the guidance of their original authors   
    - Development of novel bioinformatics tools to solve open problems   
  -   Benchmarking    
     -   Compilation of gold-truth datasets   
     -   Collection of reference algorithmic implementations   
     -   Specification of benchmarking criteria   
   -  Workflows    
     -   Definition of formal protocols   
     -   Development of tutorials for bioinformatics software usage   
   -  Data analysis   
     -   (Re)analysis of publicly available proteomics datasets   

## Guidelines

Hackathon project proposals can be submitted by creating an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/eubic/EuBIC2023/issues). 
The project proposal submission deadline is September 30th, 2022.

Please describe your **project proposal** in sufficient detail. Project proposal submissions should at least include the following 
information:

**Project description:**

   -  A general abstract of up to 200 words describing the goal of the project and why it is well suited as a community project.   
   -  A (high-level) project plan detailing the work to be conducted. This primarily includes tasks that will be tackled during the 
   developers meeting, but we encourage you to also think about a follow-up strategy.

**Technical details:**   
    -  The programming language(s) that will be used.      
    -  (If applicable) any existing software that will be featured.   
    -  (If applicable) any datasets that will be used and their availability.     

**Contact information:**   
   -   Your name and contact information.

To ensure smooth running of the developers meeting we mandate that anyone who submits a project proposal will be **responsible** for 
this project if it gets selected for inclusion into the meeting program. Submitters commit to registering for the EuBIC 2023 Developers 
Meeting and will be the main contact person managing the project. This may include some preparatory tasks prior to the Developers 
Meeting such as collecting and distributing relevant datasets or coding guidelines and coordinating tasks during the Developers Meeting.

If you are interested in one of the submitted project proposals please **indicate your support** for the corresponding GitHub issue. 
You can simply vote for your favorite projects or leave comments to the most interesting proposals. When discussing an extension 
of a project proposal please make sure to include all relevant information in this discussion as mentioned above.

### [Submit your project proposal now!](https://github.com/eubic/EuBIC2023/issues)

## Project selection

Project proposals will be selected for inclusion into the meeting's program by the scientific committee, and international teams 
will be created to implement the solutions envisioned. Selection criteria include the scientific merit of the proposal and 
the community interest.
